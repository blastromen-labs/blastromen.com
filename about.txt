Blastromen, a Finnish electronic music duo founded in 2003 by Mika Rosenberg and Sami Koskivaara, blends old-school electro, synthesizer music, modern techno, and synthwave. Their sound pays homage to the past while embracing the future, creating a unique blend of futuristic themes, intricate production, catchy melodies, and vocoder vocals.

Beyond music production, Blastromen crafts high-quality music videos and live visuals, touring globally with a distinctive LED light show. In 2004, they debuted with their 12" EP Robot Aggression on Finland's X0X Records. This was followed by another EP, Blasteroids, and two albums, Human Beyond (2010) and Reality Opens (2014), released on Dominance Electricity.

Since their first release, Blastromen has gained a loyal following in the electro scene worldwide, performing at events across Finland, Germany, the USA, Spain, and Russia. Their live shows feature custom LED poles and suits, synced to follow the music in real-time. In July 2018, Blastromen launched their third album, Cyberia, and are now set to tour Europe again.
